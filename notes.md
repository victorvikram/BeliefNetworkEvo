which nodes are co-evolving together?
- identify nodes that share sets of neighbours over time



Todo- conditional GED comparisons, compare all nodes.
Need to articulate:
- how do some of the related nodes to POLVIEWS, like PARTYID, differ?
- what are the differences between the two conditions? basic approach: compare each network node-by-node and see which have same neighbour sets and which have different sets. Use jaccard index to measure similarity.
