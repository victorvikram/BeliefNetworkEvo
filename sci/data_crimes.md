CRIMES!!!!

29/07/24

The EQWLTH code is hard to vectorise between -1 and 1. 

Why? The question is asked as: "Should Government reduce income differences?" with responses ranging from "They should not" to "They should". 

It is dubious to put this on a scale of -1 (anti-belief ) to 0 (lack-of-belief) to 1 (belief) because the question may from "They should not" as a lack-of-belief, rather than an anti-belief. 

Nonetheless, we proceed with the mapping because it's the best thing we can do. 

Ising model's are fundamentally models of directed charges, so we must invoke direction somehow. We cannot have beliefs that range only 0 to 1. 

There may be other beliefs suffering from the same issue. They will be tracked here... 


ATTEND is even worse. This question, like TVHOURS, or the news one, cannot be avoided because the question asks how often you attend church. Firstoff, this isn't even a belief, so we could easily do away with it. Second, there is no way to map this to the scale of -1 (anti-belief ) to 0 (lack-of-belief) to 1 (belief). 

We will flag these beliefs as problematic. For the time being, not attending church will be set to 0 (lack-of-belief) and regularly attending will be set to 1. There will be no -1. This implies that not attending church cannot make you stressed or unstressed. This is problematic!!! We should get rid of this belief. BUT for now we will keep it!!
