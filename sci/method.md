# Generating corr network
What do hope from the corr networks? That
1. they are not too sensitive to minor fluctuations in data
2. edges denote genuine interactions between variables
3. they are not too dense
4. that there is persistent structure across the windows but some level of change in each

questions:
1. should we include political party and liberal/conservative?
2. how do we deal with cases where variables are perfectly correlated (like the variables about raising children) so they don't have any partial correlations with the other ones. somehow for each variable I need to be able to say these are the ones I want to control for in the partial correlation, but of course then I cannot use the matrix inversion method which doesn't account for that stuff
