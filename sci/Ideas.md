try different conditionings
- condition on "supports big gob" and "supports small gov"
- condition on race, class, gender, age
- condition on internet usage
- condition on beliefs that change a lot over time


- generally, could condition on variables that are fairly polarised, so as to ensure sample size isn't crushed
