Questions
- If we were to cluster beliefs into political ideologies, does it *really* make sense to invoke a split between physical/circumstantial attributes and beliefs? For example, is (should) being black, rich, addicted to drugs, lonely, or popular, part of your ideology? I want to sort out our concepts before we dive into analysis on ideologies.  


Try different conditionings
- condition on "supports big gob" and "supports small gov"
- condition on race, class, gender, age
- condition on internet usage
- condition on beliefs that change a lot over time
- generally, could condition on variables that are fairly polarised, so as to ensure sample size isn't crushed 

Diffusion map approach for understanding the manifold in the high dimensional belief space

More generally, review of dim-reduction techniques is here:

These people used World Values Survey (WVS) + European Values Study (EVS) and do "Latent Dirichlet Allocation" for clustering beliefs.

- Worth understanding / we defs need to use this as a point of reference for our project.
- What this ofc doesn't capture is the detailed of the connections between clusters, which is something we can conceivably do with BNs, and via activation of our brains using belief vectors.

Themes for narratives that I'm starting to build are:
1. Belief-detail and "intersectional" (conditioned) view of polaristion
2. Ideological clustering
3. Subjectivity of belief networks (i.e., do conservatives, liberals, whatever, agree on structure (also need to flesh out proper interpretation of this))
4. Structural evolution of BNs / dynamics of belief-spaces (also, linking the notion of vector cluster and belief network cluster would be interesting to me) 
5. Ideology-respecting paths (just think this could be a good meme paper honestly)
