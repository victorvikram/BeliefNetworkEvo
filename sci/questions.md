This file contains questions we would like to ask about the belief networks. 

# Hypothesis/Question-motivated Analysis
1. **Stability and instability of local structures in the belief network.**
  a. Does an analog of social balance hold on the network? That is, are "stable" triads more likely to persist than unstable ones?
  b. What about cycles? Cycles with an odd number of negative edges might be unstable.
2. **Module structure and dynamics**
  a. Is it easier to enter a module than to leave it?
  b. Do modules aggregate and split in different ways (e.g. does merging happen gradually while splitting is sudden)?
  c. Is there a defined and persistent module structure to the beliefs (beyond just different question types or something)? Do different modules correspond to salient value dimensions?
  d. This may relate to 9, since modules 
  d. How flexible is the correlation structure? That is 
4. **Ideology clusters**
  a. Are there unallowable regions of the ideology space?
  b. Do moving clusters follow ideology-respecting paths?
  c. Do the people in the clusters that move have a particular structure to their belief networks?
5. **Centrality questions**
  a. Do more central beliefs get trapped or do they evolve more?
  b. Are more central beliefs associated with voting behavior?
6. **Subpopulations**
  a. would be interesting to see if there is a difference in beliefs structures when conditioning on the strength of party affiliation. Do independents have a different structure of collective beliefs than the others?
  b. what about people who changed party votes? in any sample we often have to voting records for a person so we can see if they voted for different parties
   c. can define subpopulations by regions in the space, and then look at their belief network and compare, see 4c.
7. **Voting**
  a. are beliefs correlated with voting more central?
  b. are beliefs associated with voting slower-changing?
8. **Party and ideology** how do the variables that most strongly influence party identification change over time? is there some pattern where, for instance, certain variables are particularly well-suited to becoming associated with a particular party?
9. **Structure flexibility** ising models have energy valleys of configurations that work together. I wonder if there is an analog of that for this system. Can we look at how many "allowable configurations" there are, and how distributed they are in the space? This might be tied up with modules because modules might be sets of nodes that can vary relatively independently of one another.

# Exploratory Analysis
1. **Rate of change**
  a. Does link creation and deletion happen at a constant rate? If not, when are the spikes?
  b. Can make a rate of change network to see what its structure is
2. **Typical measures**
  a. degree distribution, ...
