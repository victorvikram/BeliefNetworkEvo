# Outline
What do we want to say on the poste

## Motivation
- political polarization and partisan gridlock go together: one causes the other

- yet polarization is about beliefs, while gridlock is about action (or lack thereof)

- in pure "majority rules", polarization doesn't matter: just go with the majority

- but collectives, like individuals, deliberate on their decisions

- in deliberation, polarization, and more generally, the structure of beliefs, matters

- Imagine two pairs of people deliberating on an issue.
    - Pair 1: crime is an *education* issue vs. crime is an *policing* issue
    - Pair 2: policing is tyrannical vs. policing ensures public safety
    - the deliberators  have different associations between crime, education, policing, tyranny, and public safety
    - in a simple vote, both pairs would take opposite sides on a law increasing policing.
    - in a deliberative process, pair 1 might more easily compromise than pair 2

- our goal: to study the structure and evolution of relationships between beliefs 

## Questions
1. How much do beliefs constrain each other? How small is the set of permissible beliefs?
    - for instance, perhaps beliefs on women's rights and porn laws would be relatively isolated,
    with people choosing each one independently, or they may be tightly connected, where holding one
    implies you hold the other
2. Is there a common "point of departure" that subgroups of the population agree on?
    - for instance, people may disagree on issues, but might nonetheless agree on the relationship 
    between them: e.g., if you want more immigration, you should also want free trade.

## Method
We plan to analyze:
- belief networks, which show partial correlations between beliefs, and
- belief spaces, which collapse the set of beliefs into a smaller number of dimensions

This poster: preliminary analyses on belief networks for questions (1) and (2)
1. How does the interconnectedness of the network change over time? 
2. Are associations between beliefs different between liberals and conservatives?
