This file contains questions we would like to ask about the belief networks. 

# Stability and instability of local structures in the belief network
1. Does an analog of "social balance" hold on the relationship between beliefs? Are certain triangles stable and others not? 

# Global structure of the belief network 
1. Does the network have a modular structure? To what extent is it modular?
2. How do models change over time? Are they more likely to merge than to split? What causes splits in modules?

# Centrality in the belief network
1. Are there beliefs that are more central in the belief network (more highly correlated with others)? Are these beliefs slower to change in the population than less centrally located ones?

# Relationship with voting behavior
1. Which beliefs are most correlated with voting behavior? What placement do they have in the belief network?
